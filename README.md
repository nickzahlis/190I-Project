  - The sound icon means that the audience cannot hear you.
  - The question icon means that the audience does not understand what you are saying and you may need to make better word choices.
  - The exclamation icon means that you are speaking a little too nervously and the audience may be losing interest.
  - The icon with two people means that the audience needs to be engaged more and you can be more expressive.
