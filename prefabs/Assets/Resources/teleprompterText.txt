Hey everyone and welcome to our demonstration. For our project, we decided to make a utility that allows people to practice and improve their public speaking skills. On top of this, we think that our application could be used to help people get over their fear of public speaking. 
As you can see, I'm reading off a teleprompter that can be used to help with cadence and memorization. In addition, we have three meters that inform the user on their tone, volume, and speaking speed. For now, the volume bar is a simple input from the microphone. The other two meters, for tone and speed, have yet to be implemented. On the right side of the meters, we have another display that the AI can use to give more detailed instructions to the speaker. For example, if I wasn't making eye contact with people in the crowd, it might instruct me to. 
Some improvements that we're considering are more detailed controls for the teleprompter, functionality for the tone and speed meters, and maybe some hard-coded instructions for the other display. One example might be instructing the user to reposition on the stage if they move too far away from the microphone. In addition, using an average volume instead of the live volume from the microphone could be another improvement.
With that being said, this concludes our demo and we'd be happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions you might have.
